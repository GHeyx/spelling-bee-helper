# spelling-bee-helper
Spelling Bee Helper is an application created to assist in the New York Times game Spelling Bee.
I use this at the end of the day when I am curious about what other words can be created from the given letters, as they are only published the following day.

I created a version of the app using custom tkinter for the GUI, and then decided to recreat the app using the Flet framework to make it more visually appealing.
